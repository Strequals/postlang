Executables are under debug in the compiler and interpreter folders.
They take command line arguments, so if added to PATH, they can be used as follows:
to compile - postlang_c_0_1 <file_name>
to run - postlang_re_0_1 <file_name>
Source files should end in the extension .postl, and compiled files will end in the extension .postc
A number of example programs are included, as well as their compiled bytecodes.
